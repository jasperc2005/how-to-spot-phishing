How to Spot a Phishing Email: Realistic (But Obvious) Examples — and Why They’re Danger
“Below are simulated phishing emails you can use to teach colleagues and readers what to watch for. Each example is intentionally obvious and annotated with the red flags to help you spot scams quickly.”





Example 1 — Credential-harvesting (classic fake account alert)

[SIMULATION — EDUCATIONAL ONLY]

From: Customer Support support@microsoftt.invalid

To: you@yourcompany.com

Subject: Urgent — Verify Your Account Now or It Will Be Closed

Hello,

The four main red flags within this email are:

1. A sense of urgency, most phishing promt for fast action, this creates a pressure and doe not allow the user to do research.
2. Generic naming, the sender uses 'Hello', if it is a genuine compant they are likely to have you information.
3. The domain here is not matching the typical microsoft.com domain, if the email did have microsoft.com as the domain it is likely that the email is legitimate unless being spoofed.



How to check if an EMAIL ADRESS is spoofed?


Quick checklist (do this first)

Don’t click links or open attachments.

Check the visible sender (display name) vs the email address shown — display names are trivially faked.

View the full message headers (instructions below).

Verify authentication results in the headers (SPF / DKIM / DMARC).

Confirm the first Received: hop IP makes sense for that sender — corporate mail normally comes from known provider IPs.

If still unsure, contact the sender using a known-good channel (phone, corporate directory), not by replying to the suspicious message.

How to view full headers (common clients)

Gmail (web): open message → click ⋮ (three dots) → Show original.

Outlook (desktop): open message → File → Properties → Internet headers (or Message Options).

Outlook (web): open → ⋯ → View message source.

Apple Mail: View → Message → Raw Source.

Mobile apps often hide headers; use the desktop/web client when possible.

What to look for in the headers (and what it means)

Search the headers for these lines and interpret them:

Authentication-Results:

Look for spf=pass or spf=fail (or neutral, softfail).

Look for dkim=pass or dkim=fail.

Look for dmarc=pass or dmarc=fail.
If SPF and/or DKIM and DMARC pass, the message is far more likely to be authentic. If one or more fail, that’s a red flag — but not definitive on its own.

Return-Path (envelope from) vs From: header

Attackers often set the From: to a forged address but the underlying Return-Path (bounce address) or envelope-from will differ. Mismatch can indicate spoofing.

Received: lines (read bottom→top)

The bottom-most Received: is the first server that accepted the message from the sender. Check the originating IP and hostname — does it match the sender’s mail provider (e.g., Google, Microsoft, your company mail servers)?

If it came directly from an unexpected residential IP or a country/provider that doesn’t match the sender, that’s suspicious.

DKIM-Signature:

Presence of a valid DKIM signature means the sending domain cryptographically signed the message; dkim=pass indicates the signature is valid and that the headers/body weren’t tampered with after signing.

SPF check:

SPF compares the sending IP against the domain’s SPF DNS TXT record. spf=pass is good. spf=fail is suspicious.

Note: SPF can fail legitimately for forwarded mail (because the forwarder’s IP isn’t in the original domain’s SPF), so interpret carefully.

DMARC policy:

DMARC tells receivers what to do if SPF/DKIM fail. A p=reject published by the sending domain makes spoofing much harder; p=none means domain owner isn’t enforcing.

Reply-To and List-Id headers

Check Reply-To — attackers sometimes put a different reply-to address to capture responses.
