The four main red flags within this email are:

1. A sense of urgency, most phishing promt for fast action, this creates a pressure and doe not allow the user to do research.
2. Generic naming, the sender uses 'Hello', if it is a genuine compant they are likely to have you information.
3. The domain here is not matching the typical microsoft.com domain, if the email did have microsoft.com as the domain it is likely that the email is legitimate unless being spoofed.
